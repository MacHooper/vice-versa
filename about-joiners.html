            <p>The Joiners Arms has seen some of the biggest names in music walk through its doors over the last 50 years, including Oasis, Primal Scream, Coldplay, Green Day and many others.</p>
            <p>Despite the closures of grassroots venues across the country The Joiners has remained opened thanks to its hard-working team and supportive local scene. It was voted best small venue by NME in 2013 and its legacy is well known across the music scene, anyone who is anyone probably played itâ€™s stage at some point.</p>
            <p>Holding Vice Versa Festival at The Joiners gave us the opportunity to celebrate its history by making use of its basement. Currently used to store alcohol, we are kitting it out and making it into a club room where we will have surprise DJs and music from artists who have played there.</p>
